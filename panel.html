    <h1>CNSM 2025 Distinguished Expert Panel</h1>


      <h2 class="cn-blue">Sustainable Network Management in the Age of AI: Reducing Power Consumption and Carbon Footprint</h2>

      <p  class="cnsm-theme">
      This panel will address the urgent need to design and operate communication networks that are both high-performing and environmentally sustainable. As global data traffic continues to surge, AI-driven methods are emerging as powerful enablers for optimizing energy efficiency across network infrastructures, services, and operations. Panelists from academia, industry, and network operators will share insights on how AI can drive reductions in power consumption and carbon footprint without compromising innovation, reliability, or user experience. The conversation will not only highlight technical solutions but also examine economic models, and collaborative strategies to align network evolution with global sustainability goals such as the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and carbon neutrality targets.

covering all aspects of the management of networks and services,
pervasive systems, enterprises, and cloud computing environments.
Demonstrations showcasing new working systems, innovative
applications, ground-breaking ideas, and novel concepts related to
  network and service management are most welcome.</p>

preferably
incorporating a demo system architecture illustration, using the IEEE
2-column conference format, and are limited to 3 pages including
references. Besides the technical approach and methodology, the
proposal should describe what the CNSM audience will experience during
the demonstration. The proposal should provide the demo background and
further focus on the demo settings and the application, possibly with
  visual outcomes to illustrate the scope of the demo.</p>


<p>Demo papers will be peer-reviewed and accepted demo papers will be
included in the digital conference proceedings provided to CNSM

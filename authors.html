<h1>Guidelines for Accepted Papers</h1>

<a name="formatting"></a>
<h3>1. Formatting and IEEE Xplore Compliance</h3>

<p>When your accepted paper (full paper, short paper, mini-conference paper, demo paper, poster paper, PhD symposium paper, workshop paper) is presented, it will appear soon afterwards on IEEE Xplore® (the IEEE Digital Library) and it is important that your submitted PDF file meets the specification for IEEE Xplore.</p>

<h3>1.1 Page Limit</h3>

The page limits are as follows:

<ul>
  <li> CNSM full papers: 9 pages (including references);</li>
  <li> CNSM mini-conference papers: 7 pages (including references);</li>
  <li> CNSM short/poster papers: 5 pages (including references);</li>
  <li> CNSM demo papers: 3 pages (including references);</li>
  <li> CNSM PhD symposium papers: 4 pages (including references);</li>
  <li> Workshop papers: 6 pages (including references).</li>
</ul>

<p>Please address the suggestions raised by the reviewers to improve the quality of your paper and make sure to comply with all formatting requirements. Please note that it is not possible to purchase extra pages.</p>

<h3>1.2 Templates</h3>

<p>Please format your final submission using the guidelines provided in <a href="http://www.ieeelcn.org/IEEE_conf_layout.pdf">IEEE_conf_layout.pdf</a>. The guidelines are implemented in IEEE templates. LaTex authors please verify you are using the following documentclass:

  <br>
  <br>
  <code> \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} </code>
  <br>
  <br>


  Only in case you are unable to use LaTex, other text processors may be used at your own risk. IEEE provides a template for Word in US-Letter size. Your final submission must follow all IEEE conference formatting requirements (e.g., font sizes, margins, and layout). Thus, check them really carefully.

<h3>2. Paper Upload</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Before uploading your paper, please:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check that title and abstract in EDAS match your camera-ready paper exactly</li>
  <li>
    Please use Title Case for the paper title,&nbsp;
    <em>i.e.</em>
    &nbsp;capitalizing all main words
  </li>
  <li>Compare all author names in EDAS with the author list in your paper. They must be identical and in the same order</li>
  <li>Enter all middle names/initials you prefer to use in the paper in the author profile EDAS, as well</li>
  <li>Ensure that special characters in the paper match the EDAS entry. EDAS supports UTF-8 special characters, such as Ã¤Ã¯Ã¶Ã¼ÃŸÃ®Ã§Ã±Ã©, etc. for author names</li>
  <li>Have the PDF checked or created by IEEE PDFXpress (see instructions below); upload the certified file returned from IEEE PDFXpress into EDAS</li>
</ul>

<p>This is very important because we will be using the information provided in EDAS to generate the final conference program and the table of contents for IEEE Xplore. Please note that the abstract and title should be readable stand-alone and not contain any references or unexplained acronyms.</p>


<a name="notice"></a>
<h3>3. Copyright Notice</h3>

<p>The Publication Chairs will add the copyright notice to your paper.</p>

<p>In case you need to modify the title or the abstract, please ask the TPC Co-Chairs for approval. Changes to the list of authors, allowed only under exceptional circumstances, have also to be approved by TPC Co-Chairs. All the camera-ready papers have to be submitted via EDAS.</p>

<a name="pdfexpress"></a>
<h3>4. PDF Express</h3>

<p>Use <a href="https://ieee-pdf-express.org/account/login" target="_blank">IEEE PDF eXpress</a> to check Xplore-compatibility. <em>The CNSM 2025 conference ID to access PDF eXpress will be posted here soon.</em>
<!-- the CNSM 2024 account uses as the conference ID: <em>67658X</em> --> </p>

<p>EDAS will prevent you from uploading papers that do not comply with formatting checks. Please check all requirements carefully again if that happens. If you believe your paper is compliant and you are still prevented from uploading, please send your PDF eXpress™-certified PDF file to the publication chairs and ask for advice. Please always put your EDAS paper number in the subject line of email communication. </p>

<a name="copyright"></a>
<h3>5. IFIP Copyright Form</h3>

<p>Authors of CNSM, are required to transfer the copyright of their accepted papers to IFIP.</p>

<p>In this case you have to upload the IFIP form. First, click <a href="files/ifip-copyright.pdf">here</a> to get the IFIP copyright form. Read and fill it up adequately. Don’t forget to include the title of your work, the first and last names of all the authors, and then sign it. After getting the copyright ready, log onto EDAS and click on the copyright logo (&copy;) of your accepted CNSM or Workshop paper. Update the signed copyright, following instructions on EDAS. Once you finish that process, EDAS will show the type and date of copyright submission on your paper page.</p>


<a name="acmmetadata"></a>
<h3>6. Metadata for ACM Digital Library</h3>

<p>Please ignore this section, for the time being. We will provide further instructions in case we need to collect the paper's metadata.</p>
<!--
<p>Authors are required to submit metadata from their accepted paper(s) in order to speed up the process of generating the proceedings and registering them in the ACM library. Please complete the Google form available at https://forms.gle/hf8DokG7nWznTSB8A and upload in EDAS the receipt (copy in PDF) of the answers provided to Google.</p>

<h3>8. Poster Presentation Guidelines</h3>

<p>Preferred Size and Layout: A0 (Height: 1189 mm × Width: 841 mm) in
  portrait orientation is recommended. Please leave a margin of at least 30 mm on each side to make the poster fit on the provided poster board.</p>

<h2>Guidelines for Accepted Papers</h2>

<a name="formatting"></a>
<h3>1. Formatting and IEEE Xplore Compliance</h3>

<p>When your accepted paper (full paper, mini-conference paper, short/poster paper, workshop paper) is presented, it will appear soon afterwards on IEEE Xplore® (the IEEE Digital Library) and it is important that your submitted PDF file meets the specification for IEEE Xplore.</p>

<h3>1.1 Page Limit</h3>

The page limits, where all paper lengths must include the references, are as follows:

<ul>
  <li> CNSM full papers: 9 pages (including references);</li>
  <li> CNSM mini-conference papers: 7 pages (including references);</li>
  <li> CNSM short/poster papers: 5 pages (including references);</li>
  <li> Workshop full papers: 7 pages (including references).</li>
</ul>

<p>Please address the suggestions raised by the reviewers to improve the quality of your paper and make sure to comply with all formatting requirements. Please note that it is not possible to purchase extra pages.</p>

<h3>1.2 Templates</h3>

<p>Please format your final submission using the guidelines provided in <a href="http://www.ieeelcn.org/IEEE_conf_layout.pdf">IEEE_conf_layout.pdf</a>. The guidelines are implemented in IEEE templates. LaTex authors please verify you are using the following documentclass:

  <br>
  <br>
  <code> \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} </code>
  <br>
  <br>


  Only in case you are unable to use LaTex, other text processors may be used at your own risk. IEEE provides a template for Word in US-Letter size. Your final submission must follow all IEEE conference formatting requirements (e.g., font sizes, margins, and layout). Thus, check them really carefully.

<h3>2. Paper Upload</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Before uploading your paper, please:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check that title and abstract in EDAS match your camera-ready paper exactly</li>
  <li>
    Please use Title Case for the paper title,&nbsp;
    <em>i.e.</em>
    &nbsp;capitalizing all main words
  </li>
  <li>Compare all author names in EDAS with the author list in your paper. They must be identical and in the same order</li>
  <li>Enter all middle names/initials you prefer to use in the paper in the author profile EDAS, as well</li>
  <li>Ensure that special characters in the paper match the EDAS entry. EDAS supports UTF-8 special characters, such as Ã¤Ã¯Ã¶Ã¼ÃŸÃ®Ã§Ã±Ã©, etc. for author names</li>
  <li>Have the PDF checked or created by IEEE PDFXpress; upload the certified file returned from IEEE PDFXpress into EDAS</li>
</ul>

<p>This is very important because we will be using the information provided in EDAS to generate the final conference program and the table of contents for IEEE Xplore. Please note that the abstract and title should be readable stand-alone and not contain any references or unexplained acronyms.</p>

<h3>3. Copyright Notice</h3>

<p>The Publication Chair will add the copyright notice to your paper.</p>

<p>In case you need to modify the title or the abstract, you can do this through EDAS. Changes to the list of authors, allowed only under exceptional circumstances, have to be approved by TPC chairs. All the camera-ready papers have to be submitted via EDAS.</p>

<h3>4. PDF Express</h3>

<p>Use <a href="https://ieee-pdf-express.org/account/login">IEEE PDF eXpress</a> to check Xplore-compatibility, the CNSM 2024 account uses as the conference ID: <em>62983X</em></p>

<p>EDAS will prevent you from uploading papers that do not comply with formatting checks. Please check all requirements carefully again if that happens. If you believe your paper is compliant and you are still prevented from uploading, please send your PDF eXpress™-certified PDF file to the publication chair and ask for advice. Please always put your EDAS paper number in the subject line of email communication. </p>

<h3>5. IFIP Copyright Form</h3>

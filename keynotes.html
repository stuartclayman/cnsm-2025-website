<h2 id="key1" class="cn-blue" style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.5em;">The Memory Layer for Web3</h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Muriel  Médard</h3>

<p>Traditional computing follows the von Neumann architecture, where a compute/control unit interacts with read/write memory via a bus. Compute/control relies crucially on memory and access to it. This model has underpinned decades of innovation.
Web3 has traditionally developed technologies such as virtual machines (VMs), that map onto von Neumann’s compute/control framework. Data propagation (bus) and access (read/write memory), however, have emerged as present critical constraints in decentralized environments.
We  introduce a breakthrough in Web3 infrastructure by using network coding for data propagation (MumP2P) and decentralized random access memory (DeROM/DeRAM) for data read/writes. Optimum acts as a virtualized dedicated memory layer, enabling high-speed data
 propagation, secure access, and real-time updates over a permissionless, decentralized, and potentially unreliable network of nodes. By leveraging Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC), Optimum ensures optimum propagation across a decentralized network. It also
  ensures atomic, consistent, and durable data access, while maintaining high throughput and low latency.</p>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Alexander Clemm</h3>

<p>The reduction of humankind's environmental footprint has become one of the defining concerns of our time. Networks have long played a key role in this quest as they allow to substitute carbon-intensive transport of persons or physical goods with digital communications.  However, more recently the environmental footprint of networks themselves is increasingly coming into focus, by network operators who strive to become "net zero" and reduce their energy cost as well as by researchers who are looking for impactful problems to be solved.  While reducing energy usage is a part of the equation, many factors complicate matters, chief among them the fact that energy usage is generally not proportional with network load.  As a result, simply (for example) reducing the volume of data that is exchanged may not lead to a meaningful impact at all. 
 
This presentation will explore some of the challenges that are associated with making networks environmentally more sustainable, specifically at Layers 3 and above. Among others, the IETF has recently also been stepping up its activities in this space and an overview of some of the efforts currently under way there will be given. The presentation will also touch on a few solution approaches as well as how other important developments in the network and service management space from Intent-Based Networking to the advent of Generative AI may tie into this problem space and create a rich set of opportunities.

<i>Alexander Clemm</i> is a recognized expert in network management technology and networking software in which he has been involved from inception to customer delivery throughout his career. His most recent activities have been in the areas of sustainable networking, future networking services, intent-based networking, service assurance, and telemetry.  After 7+ years as a Distinguished Engineer at Futurewei and prior to that 18 years at Cisco, he recently decided to pursue an academic sabbatical and embark on new adventures.  Alex has for many years been regularly serving on the committees of CNSM, NOMS/IM and NetSoft, including on some occasions as a general co-chair or TPC co-chair. He is the recipient of the 2020 Salah Aidarous Award given by IEEE CNOM and IFIP TC6.6 to "an individual who has provided unremitting service and dedication to the IT and Telecommunications Network Operations and Management community".  Alex has an extensive publication record including 70+ papers, 70+ patents, and 16 RFCs. He holds an M.S. degree from Stanford University and a Ph.D. from the University of Munich, Germany, both in Computer Science.
